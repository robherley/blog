## History of tiny.coffee

There are people in this world that suffer from an incredible problem -- the **unresistable urge** to buy vanity domains. I am one of those people, and one of favorites (excluding my brief ownership of `ibm.lol`)[^1] is [tiny.coffee](https://tiny.coffee).

[^1]: Unfortunately had to release `ibm.lol` after NameCheap forwarded me a letter from IBM IP Law Department. I didn't want to lose my job at the time ðŸ˜…

At first I didn't know _what_ I wanted to do with it, but then I was inspired by [parrot.live](https://github.com/hugomd/parrot.live)! When running `curl parrot.live`, you will be greeted with a ASCII party parrot in your terminal:

![parrot live screenshot](/content/tiny.coffee/parrot.png "Example of `curl parrot.live`")

I decided to [fork it](https://github.com/robherley/tiny.coffee/commit/fe46c464d1ab3ae7435b36e6cdca0f8b3d61717c) into `tiny.coffee`. It just required a few HTML and ASCII changes, the JavaScript code was practically identical and didn't need major tweaks. After adding a Dockerfile, it was deployed!

Although, my ASCII art left a lot to be desired:

If a user made a request via a web browser (or anything else without `curl` in the user agent), it would respond with a simple HTML webpage with a tiny party parrot holding coffee.

## Aging like milk

The first version of `tiny.coffee` was deployed ~4 years ago and a bit has changed since then. It's been moved from more machines/clouds than I can count. Most recently it was just a static site hosted on Vercel without the special curl user agent code path. This was meant to be temporary, but changing apartments/jobs and countless homelab rebuilds left it in limbo.

So, with my now ["stable" homelab](/posts/01-homelab-pt1/), I decide to spin it up again. I was quickly greeted by a familar site for JS devs:

```

The deprecation warnings have deprecation warnings. And even better:

```text

19 vulnerabilities (1 low, 8 moderate, 9 high, 1 critical)

To address issues that do not require attention, run:
  npm audit fix

To address all issues (including breaking changes), run:
  npm audit fix --force

Run `npm audit` for details.
```

This is why [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) and [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) are so popular in the JS community. Even an app as simple as this with only two immediate dependencies links to over 200 packages with 19 vulnerabilites (with a critical and multiple high)!

{{< terminal >}}
# listing npm dependencies
rob@mbp$ cat package.json | jq '.dependencies'
{
  "colors": "1.1.2",
  "mz": "2.7.0"
}

# size of npm dependencies
rob@mbp$ du -h node_modules
7.1M	node_modules

# how many files of npm dependencies
rob@mbp$ find node_modules -type f | wc -l
    1271
{{< /terminal >}}

And yes, many may argue both of these dependencies can be removed:
- `colors` can be replaced by [ANSI escape sequences](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prompt-HOWTO/x329.html). Still has [24.8M weekly downloads](https://www.npmjs.com/package/colors) on NPM at the time of writing this.
- `mz` isn't nessary anymore in modern Node versions since we have [`fs/promises`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#promises-api) and [`util.promisify`](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#utilpromisifyoriginal). Still has [3.8M weekly downloads](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mz) on NPM at the time of writing this.

Instead of patching these dependencies, I figured it'd be a fun afternoon project to rewrite this in Go!

## The rewrite

To me, Go was a perfect replacement. It has a great HTTP server in the [`net/http`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http) standard library and the static content (HTML & ASCII art) can actually be embeded in the binary directly using [`embed`](https://pkg.go.dev/embed) in Go >= 1.16. Everything required is already in the standard library, which means no dependencies!

### Embedding static files

This can't be easier. To "embed" a static file into the Go binary, it just needs a brief `//go:embed` comment above the variable, and it will contain the specified data at runtime:

```go
var (
  //go:embed static/index.html
  indexHTML []byte // binary content of the index.html

  //go:embed frames/*.txt
  frameFS embed.FS // read-only filesystem containing ASCII coffee frames

  //...
)
```

Now, the compiled binary can be moved around without depending on a specific folder structure/path.

### Serving the coffee

I'll be using the default router in the `net/http` package and adding a single route to handle all requests. It will follow this pattern:

{{< mermaid >}}
%%{init: {'theme': 'dark' } }%%
stateDiagram-v2
    state ua <<choice>>
    new_req: new request
    stream: streaming
    frame: send frame
    html: render html
    timeout: 2min timeout
    user_close: user closed conn

    new_req --> ua
    ua --> stream: user-agent = curl
    ua --> html: user-agent = *

    stream --> frame: every 100ms
    frame --> stream

    stream --> timeout
    stream --> user_close

    timeout --> [*]
    user_close --> [*]
{{< /mermaid >}}

Nothing too complicated going on here, this can be contained to a `for...select` block with a couple channels. To account for both the user closing the connection and the two minute timeout, the default [`Request.Context`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Request.Context) can be wrapped in the [`context.WithTimeout`](https://pkg.go.dev/context#WithTimeout) and those cases can be handled together in a single channel. Otherwise, a [`time.Ticker`](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Ticker) will be used to send ANSI codes and a ASCII coffee frame every 100ms.

```go
idx := 0
ticker := time.NewTicker(time.Millisecond * 100)
reqCancelCtx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(r.Context(), time.Minute * 2)
defer cancel()

for {
  select {
  case <-reqCancelCtx.Done():
    w.Write([]byte("no more coffee :(\n"))
    return
  case <-ticker.C:
    w.Write(ansiClear)
    w.Write(ansiColors[idx%len(ansiColors)])
    w.Write(frames[idx%len(frames)])
    w.Write(ansiReset)
    if f, ok := w.(http.Flusher); ok {
      f.Flush()
    }
    idx = idx + 1
  }
}
```

Note the `f.Flush()`, the default `http.Transport` in Go has a [default write buffer size of 4KB](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.17.8:src/net/http/transport.go;l=262-265), so the response writer will need to be flushed in order to get the coffee pouring in a timely matter.

### Fresh coat of paint

My original ASCII art was horrible and the coffee mug was quite large for a _tiny coffee_, so I found some nice ASCII from [ascii-art.de](http://www.ascii-art.de/ascii/c/coffee.txt) and slightly modified the "Double Espresso" from an unknown author.

![new tiny coffee](/content/tiny.coffee/coffee-new.png "New output of `curl tiny.coffee`")


The HTML also needed some sprucing up. I wanted to publicize the main attraction, so slapping `curl tiny.coffee` in the center of the page with a link to the source code under it seemed appropriate. Finally, making the original coffee party parrot bounce around like a mid-2000s DVD screensaver was the icing on the cake.

## Bonus: Containerization and CI/CD

Static Go binaries are great, but they're only portable to their target architecture/OS. It'd be great to automatically build and push a container image. With about ~50 lines of YAML this can be automated with GitHub Actions.

For the container itself, I'll be using the base debian variant of [Google's distroless container images](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless). [Here's the Dockerfile](https://github.com/robherley/tiny.coffee/blob/eebe8913e8094d44e3f29edd1e1f86d16bbe4c2f/Dockerfile).

When a tag is pushed, the workflow will:

1. Create a new release via [`actions/github-script@v5`](https://github.com/actions/github-script) with a tag from the git ref (ie: `vX.Y.Z`) and set it as an output.
2. Login to GitHub container registry.
3. Extract image metadata from environment variables.
4. Build and push the image with the tag from Step 1.

The workflow is [defined here](https://github.com/robherley/tiny.coffee/blob/72508ec67d139d3a19a04a70d5893f1260f6ff71/.github/workflows/ci.yaml), and the container image can be [found here](https://github.com/robherley/tiny.coffee/pkgs/container/tiny.coffee).

To run it locally, you can use `podman` or `docker`:

{{< terminal >}}
rob@mbp$ podman run -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/robherley/tiny.coffee
2022/03/07 04:24:53 serving coffee on: 0.0.0.0:8000
{{< /terminal >}}

And that's it! Enjoy your coffee â˜•

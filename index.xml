In the previous part of this series, I configured a template VM with cloud-init configs for zero intervention VM automation after provision.
In this part, I&amp;rsquo;ll setup a basic HashiCorp Terraform project for infrastructure as code (IaC) to provision the guest VMs and containers from Proxmox. This will be a great foundation for the homelab, as Terraform can be expanded to cloud automation as well, such as managing Cloudflare DNS records.</description></item><item><title>Homelab Part V: Proxmox VMs and cloud-init</title><link>https://blog.reb.gg/posts/05-homelab-pt5/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 05:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blog.reb.gg/posts/05-homelab-pt5/</guid><description>
In the previous part of this series, I setup a Proxmox dynamic inventory with Ansible and created a basic LXC template for creating containers that were automation ready.
In this part, I&amp;rsquo;ll setup some cloud-init configs to initalize VMs in a state where they can automatically be managed by Ansible.
Cloud Images While it&amp;rsquo;s possible to prepare custom base images for cloud-init, many Linux distributions already provide ready-to-use images, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, etc.</description></item><item><title>Homelab Part IV: Proxmox Dynamic Inventory and LXC Templates</title><link>https://blog.reb.gg/posts/04-homelab-pt4/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 04:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blog.reb.gg/posts/04-homelab-pt4/</guid><description>
In the previous part of this series, I configured Ansible and made some basic playbooks for the homelab management. Eventually, I&amp;rsquo;ll be deploying a plethora of VMs and containers, but managing a gigantic inventory every time a guest is spun up/down would be a hassle. Fortunately, there are community plugins for Ansible that allow the use of a Proxmox cluster as a dynamic inventory.
In this part, I&amp;rsquo;ll setup some Proxmox API users for automation, setup a dynamic inventory for Proxmox guests and prepare a template for Linux containers.</description></item><item><title>Homelab Part III: Automation with Ansible and Hardening Access</title><link>https://blog.reb.gg/posts/03-homelab-pt3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 03:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blog.reb.gg/posts/03-homelab-pt3/</guid><description>
In the previous part of this series, I created a two-node Proxmox cluster along with redundant (ZFS) and shared (NFS) storage. In this part, I&amp;rsquo;ll go over how to connect to the host machines with Ansible, harden access, and setup some minor user management. This&amp;rsquo;ll all be through an automatic, idempotent configuration process.
What is Ansible? Ansible is a great automation platform from Red Hat (they bought AnsibleWorks), and it&amp;rsquo;s an extremely popular tool making it a great learning exercise for the homelab.</description></item><item><title>Homelab Part II: Proxmox cluster, ZFS and NFS</title><link>https://blog.reb.gg/posts/02-homelab-pt2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 02:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blog.reb.gg/posts/02-homelab-pt2/</guid><description>
In the previous part of this series, I assembled (and modified) hardware and setup the base operating systems on the machines. In this part, I&amp;rsquo;ll go over how to connect the Proxmox nodes together, add a quorum device and provision some storage with ZFS. Also one of the ZFS drives will be configured with NFS to share container templates, ISOs, and snippets.
Cluster If you only have one machine in your homelab, you can skip this step.</description></item><item><title>Homelab Part I: Intro, Hardware and Proxmox install</title><link>https://blog.reb.gg/posts/01-homelab-pt1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 01:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blog.reb.gg/posts/01-homelab-pt1/</guid><description>
ðŸ‘‹ Hey y&amp;rsquo;all, welcome to the start of my homelab (or, the latest iteration of it). I&amp;rsquo;m documenting my homelab setup as a helpful guide for others to learn, detailing some of the annoying issues I encountered and some of the duct tape solutions. These are also backup instructions for when I inevitably scrap this homelab, rebuild, and forget how I did everything.
This series will be centered around the setup and automation of a Promox cluster comprised of three very different machines.</description></item></channel></rss>

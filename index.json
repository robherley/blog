Although simple, Go\u0026rsquo;s default testing output leaves a lot to be desired:\nThis has led rise to some other wrappers for go test, solely to be a better formatter for humans. For example, gotestsum does this quite well:\nThis is definitely an improvement, and gotestsum even has additional formatting like exporting to JUnit XML.\nBut, what if CI could produce a rich, interactive, summary like this:","url":"https://blog.reb.gg/posts/08-beautify-go-tests/","date_published":"2022-07-23 00:51:58 -0400 -0400","tags":["golang","testing","github","actions"]},{"id":"https://blog.reb.gg/posts/07-go-tiny-coffee/","title":"☕ Rewriting tiny.coffee to < 100 lines of Go","content_text":"History of tiny.coffee There are people in this world that suffer from an incredible problem \u0026ndash; the unresistable urge to buy vanity domains. I am one of those people, and one of favorites (excluding my brief ownership of ibm.lol)1 is tiny.coffee.\nAt first I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what I wanted to do with it, but then I was inspired by parrot.live!

This will be a great foundation for the homelab, as Terraform can be expanded to cloud automation as well, such as managing Cloudflare DNS records.","url":"https://blog.reb.gg/posts/06-homelab-pt6/","date_published":"2022-01-14 00:00:00 -0500 -0500","tags":["proxmox","vm","lxc","terraform"]},{"id":"https://blog.reb.gg/posts/05-homelab-pt5/","title":"🏡 Homelab V: Proxmox VMs and cloud-init","content_text":"In the previous part of this series, I setup a Proxmox dynamic inventory with Ansible and created a basic LXC template for creating containers that were automation ready.\nIn this part, I\u0026rsquo;ll setup some cloud-init configs to initalize VMs in a state where they can automatically be managed by Ansible.\nCloud Images While it\u0026rsquo;s possible to prepare custom base images for cloud-init, many Linux distributions already provide ready-to-use images, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, etc.","url":"https://blog.reb.gg/posts/05-homelab-pt5/","date_published":"2022-01-13 00:00:00 -0500 -0500","tags":["proxmox","vm","cloud-init"]},{"id":"https://blog.reb.gg/posts/04-homelab-pt4/","title":"🏡 Homelab IV: Proxmox Dynamic Inventory and LXC Templates","content_text":"In the previous part of this series, I configured Ansible and made some basic playbooks for the homelab management. Eventually, I\u0026rsquo;ll be deploying a plethora of VMs and containers, but managing a gigantic inventory every time a guest is spun up/down would be a hassle. Fortunately, there are community plugins for Ansible that allow the use of a Proxmox cluster as a dynamic inventory.\nIn this part, I\u0026rsquo;ll setup some Proxmox API users for automation, setup a dynamic inventory for Proxmox guests and prepare a template for Linux containers.","url":"https://blog.reb.gg/posts/04-homelab-pt4/","date_published":"2022-01-12 00:00:00 -0500 -0500","tags":["proxmox","ansible","lxc","systemd"]},{"id":"https://blog.reb.gg/posts/03-homelab-pt3/","title":"🏡 Homelab III: Automation with Ansible and Hardening Access","content_text":"In the previous part of this series, I created a two-node Proxmox cluster along with redundant (ZFS) and shared (NFS) storage. In this part, I\u0026rsquo;ll go over how to connect to the host machines with Ansible, harden access, and setup some minor user management. This\u0026rsquo;ll all be through an automatic, idempotent configuration process.\nWhat is Ansible? Ansible is a great automation platform from Red Hat (they bought AnsibleWorks), and it\u0026rsquo;s an extremely popular tool making it a great learning exercise for the homelab.","url":"https://blog.reb.gg/posts/03-homelab-pt3/","date_published":"2022-01-11 00:00:00 -0500 -0500","tags":["proxmox","ansible","ssh"]},{"id":"https://blog.reb.gg/posts/02-homelab-pt2/","title":"🏡 Homelab II: Proxmox cluster, ZFS and NFS","content_text":"In the previous part of this series, I assembled (and modified) hardware and setup the base operating systems on the machines. In this part, I\u0026rsquo;ll go over how to connect the Proxmox nodes together, add a quorum device and provision some storage with ZFS. Also one of the ZFS drives will be configured with NFS to share container templates, ISOs, and snippets.\nCluster If you only have one machine in your homelab, you can skip this step.","url":"https://blog.reb.gg/posts/02-homelab-pt2/","date_published":"2022-01-10 00:00:00 -0500 -0500","tags":["proxmox","zfs","nfs","cluster"]},{"id":"https://blog.reb.gg/posts/01-homelab-pt1/","title":"🏡 Homelab I: Intro, Hardware and Proxmox install","content_text":"👋 Hey y\u0026rsquo;all, welcome to the start of my homelab (or, the latest iteration of it).

These are also backup instructions for when I inevitably scrap this homelab, rebuild, and forget how I did everything.\nThis series will be centered around the setup and automation of a Promox cluster comprised of three very different machines.","url":"https://blog.reb.gg/posts/01-homelab-pt1/","date_published":"2022-01-09 00:00:00 -0500 -0500","tags":["proxmox","zfs","hardware"]}]}
